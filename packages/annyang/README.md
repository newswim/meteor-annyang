````html
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/annyang/2.0.0/annyang.min.js"></script>
<script>
if (annyang) {
  // Let's define a command.
  var commands = {
    'hello': function() { alert('Hello world!'); }
  };

  // Add our commands to annyang
  annyang.addCommands(commands);

  // Start listening.
  annyang.start();
}
</script>

Chrome's implementation of SpeechRecognition behaves differently based on the protocol used:

- `https://` Asks for permission once and remembers the choice.

- `http://`  Asks for permission repeatedly **on every page load**. Results are also returned significantly slower in HTTP.

For a great user experience, don't compromise on anything less than HTTPS (an SSL certificate can be as cheap as $5).
